# A Reactive HTTP Client.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WegenenVerkeer/RxHttpClient.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/WegenenVerkeer/RxHttpClient)


This HTTP Client wraps the excellent [AsyncHttpClient](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client) so that
Observables are returned, and certain best practices in HTTP communication are enforced.

TODO -- document best practices.
